Wireless Accessory Configuration (WAC) is an Apple proprietary configuration protocol/process which allows a controlling device,
such as an iPhone, to send configuration information to the accessory and have the accessory configure itself. This includes joining
a WiFi network, specifying the name the accessory should appear as, etc. 

Developers should use WAC on their AirPlay Accessories to provide an enhanced user experience when interacting
with the accessory. Apple provides Developers access to WAC as Licensed Source Release as part of the MFi Program.
Refer to Developer MFi Portal for more details on porting WAC to the accessory platform. Refer to
