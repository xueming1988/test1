// Prepping build folder
cd <ROOT> 
mkdir build

// Copy streams to build folder:
cp -r ./Streams/* ./build/

//* Setting the parameters:
//* In the main.cpp file, update the following parameters */
int freqSamp = 16000; // Supports only 16000
int frameSize_ms = 8; // Supports only 8ms, 15ms or 16ms

// Select one of the iput files to be processed in main.cpp:
//FILE * infile = fopen("MixDown.pcm","rb"); // Raw Mixdown file
//FILE * infile = fopen("Noise.pcm","rb");   // Noise only
FILE * infile = fopen("Mic_16bit.pcm","rb"); // Raw mixdown recorded on Alexa enabled device

// Building the code:
cd build
cmake ../
make

// Execute:
./VAD

// Inputs are 1 channel 16 bits signed PCM files
MixDown.pcm
Noise.pcm
Mic_16bit.pcm

// Input files need to be in the build directory. This is done in the copy streams to build folder step above.

// Output is generated in the build directory. It's named "energyVal.csv".

// Output file contains:
   // Frame Number, 
   // Voiced Energy, 
   // Ambient Energy, 
   // Voice Activity Decision, 
   // Current Frame Energy.

// Reference files can be found in Reference_Output folder
